# Changelog

## 0.10.0

 * Do not delete branches after merging a pull request, GitHub has that
   functionality now, and it can interfere with dependent pull requests.
 * Add overview pages that show everything in all repositories of an owner
   on one page.
 * Fix a bug in the queue position comment that the bot leaves.

## Older versions

 * TODO: Backfill the changelog.
