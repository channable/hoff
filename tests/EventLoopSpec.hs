-- This file contains sort-of end-to-end tests for the event loop. Incoming
-- messages are faked (supplied by the test code, as oppsed to received via the
-- web server), but the event loop does run with actual IO with a test
-- repository. The purpose of these tests is not to test the *logic* of the
-- event loop (there are unit tests for that), but to test that the interaction
-- with a real Git process works as expected.
