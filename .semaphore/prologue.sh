# Shared commands for the set-up phase of jobs

# This file is NOT usable with Semaphore's "commands_file" property, as this
# puts all the comments in this file in the build output and requires us to
# write all build steps on one line each. Instead, this file must be executed
# in the build pipelines where we use it.

# We don't use `set -x` here to show the run commands, because this would show
# authentication tokens in the build output. Instead, `set -v` prints the
# commands "as they are read".
# We do want to exit immediately after encountering an error.
# We also cannot use "set -u", as Semaphore's tooling uses unset variables in
# some places (which we can't change).

  # command as `root` as it takes settings from environment variables.)
  # We use the local scratch SSD mounted at `/mnt` to prevent running out of disk
  # space, as the Nix store takes up about 10 GiB when uncompressed, and a build
  # on the smallest Semaphore instance starts out with only 13 GiB of disk space,
  # of which 4 GiB is used by the cloned repository.
  # The SSD has (at the time of writing) 80 GiB of space, of which 32 GiB is free
  # when a build starts. If we really want to we can also consider wiping the SSD
  # before using it, we don't need to do this yet.

# Attempt to restore the Semaphore cache entry for `/nix`.

# We have this in addition to Cachix because we want to avoid hitting Cachix
# for individual store entries, as restoring `/nix` from the Semaphore cache in
# one go is a lot faster than downloading individual cache entries from
# Cachix's S3 + Cloudflare.
#
# We refresh the Nix store cache entry daily. It is populated after the first
# successful build of the day by our main pipeline.
#
# Restoring the cache can fail when the cache entry is only partially matched,
# because then it might still be in the process of being uploaded by Semaphore,
# which can be caused by a concurrent build. Since using the Semaphore cache is
# only an optimization, but not strictly necessary, we make sure that the build
# doesn't fail in this case, by making sure the exit code is always 0. When
# restoring the cache fails, we delete /nix to ensure that we are not left with
# a partially restored Nix store.
