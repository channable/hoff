# The image comes with a ssh_known_hosts file provisioned, but it lists GitHub
# by domain. SSH would try to also write the IP after it connects, to detect DNS
# spoofing, but our ssh_known_hosts is read-only and there is no user-writable
# known_hosts in the home directory. Note that the DNS spoofing detection is not
# relevant for GitHub; they announce their SSH fingerprints over https, and we
# distribute that public key and only that one, baked in.
